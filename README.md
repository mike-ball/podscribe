Podscribe - Transcribe Podcasts. Use the power of crowdscoursing to transcribe podcasts. Break up the podcast into minutes and let people transcribe as many minutes as they want.
The results are compiled together to create a full transcript of the episode, including hosts/guests (who said what).

When this app is ready, you will find it at https://podscribe.org

This app is written in Ruby on Rails and your help is not only welcome, but encouraged!
